I have studied in the field of Artificial Intelligence for the last 5 years, following my research interest about Deep Learning and Linguistics. Right now I'm finishing my Master thesis on Machine Translation, and as a side job I work as a Data Scientist. I would love to advance my understanding of the topic further, through PhD study with an experts in the field of Computational Linguistics.
