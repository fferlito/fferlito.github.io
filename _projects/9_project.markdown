The BeerExpert is a project created to include CLIPS to Android, encapsulating the knowledge elicited from a beer brewer.


It is an application embedding an expert system specialized in beers and in brewing beers. It gives suggestions based on the user preference. It contains the rules and the facts (in the folder assets) necessary to make inference with forward chaining. The information about the beers are stored in a SQLite database.
